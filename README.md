### Example workflow

```yaml
name: Create GitHub Issue for Leetcode Daily Problem

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "7 0 * * *" # UTC time

jobs:
  create_github_issue_for_leetcode_daily:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Create GH Issue for LC Daily
    permissions:
      issues: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Get daily LC problem and create new GH issue
        uses: jeremypruitt/gha-github-issue-for-leetcode-daily@master
```

## Examples

### Scheduled vs On-Demand

If you only want to run manually on-demand, and do not want it to run every day automatically, just remove the `schedule:` from the `on:` section. This leaves only the `workflow_dispatch` method, which enables the manual on-demand mechanism. Here is an example:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```
